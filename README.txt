Add a dropdown with 50+ sweeteners to your recipes so users can substitute their sweetener of choice.

== Description ==

Sugarscale is a web app that lets you convert measurements of more than 50 sweeteners. The WP-Sugarscale plugin lets you add Sugarscale powered inputs to your post so readers can dynamically substitute sweeteners right from your blog. Write a recipe that calls for 1 cup sugar and with one click a user can find out how much stevia extract to substitute. Sugarscale makes any recipe accessible to people who don't or can't consume sugar. Visit sugarscale.co for the full app.
